In this C++ project, i have used the concept of getasynckeystate() to create a program 
that works as a my custom key-board shortcut application. This is an 
application that runs on 64-bit windows operating system. the key to this is : 


if i type "music": then it opens windows media player 

if i type "cmd": then it opens command prompt 

if i type "nitish"(which is my name): then it opens my facebook account 

if i type "stack": then it opens my stack overflow account 

if i type "gmail": then it opens my gmail account

 and "exit" : for closing this application. 


(WRITE THESE COMMANDS WITHOUT ("") DOUBLE QUOTES!!!) 
So , similarly you guys can can add any keyword as for your shortcut.
and "TRY TO TYPE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THERE IS A BUG THAT I AM TRYING TO FIX, SO CURRENTLY ,
YOU NEED TO TYPE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!!!"

By this method, you can possibly open any account or anything that you want for your convinence.
 Finally, this project is for educational purpose only.
